# JoinUO

[![JoinUO](joinuo.webp)](joinuo.webp)

After dropping UO Is Not Dead, I've joined the JoinUO team to make a new portal, today available at https://uoportal.com/

For this, I've used the PHP Yii Framework. The site template was not designed by me, it was available for free on the Internet.
