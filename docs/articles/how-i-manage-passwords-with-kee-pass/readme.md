# How I manage passwords with KeePass

Someone asked me a suggestion for managing passwords, so here is how I do it.

I’ve been using [KeePassX](https://www.keepassx.org/) for years, on Linux and Windows. I also have it synced with Android by using [Keepass2Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=keepass2android.keepass2android).

For syncing it between devices, I save my *.kdbx*, the password database managed by KeePass, on [Dropbox](https://db.tt/Bxtdp7dq). So every time I update the password database, I get the updates automatically on all other devices.

KeePass has a pretty useful password generator where you can, for example, generate 16-characters alphanumeric pass. You can see that 16 chars are good enough for a pass:

And you don’t ever need to remember this generated password. KeePass can auto-type the passwords for you. All you need to remember is the Master Pass, which you use to unlock your passwords database (the *.kdbx* file).

The ideal scenario is having a unique password for each site/service you have an account. So in case of a breach on one of them, you’ll just need to change the password for one site.

And I’ve chosen KeePass over [LastPass](https://lastpass.com), [Dashlane](https://www.dashlane.com/) or any other online password manager mainly because I wanted to have the database under my control and keep it accessible off-line.

Is there anything else I could tell about how I manage passwords? If so, feel free to ask and I’ll try to answer the best way I can.
