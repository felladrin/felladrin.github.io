# Connecting Developers to Companies with Suitable Job Vacancies Through Brazilian Platforms

Out of curiosity, I registered my profile on some matching platforms for developers and opportunities in the IT field here in Brazil. The result surprised me.

Two weeks after registration, I had already been invited for interviews with two companies. Even without actively seeking job openings, two months later the invitations had accumulated to five. It was the recruiters themselves who viewed my profile and reached out.

In other words, the platforms deliver what they promise. And for that reason, I'm quickly passing through to list the platforms that brought the best results:

ProgramaThor: https://programathor.com.br

GeekHunter: https://geekhunter.com.br

Some of them allow you to improve your position in the search results viewed by recruiters, simply by completing proficiency tests (javascript, python, java, ruby, etc.) within the platform itself.

It's also worth mentioning that these aren't only for in-person opportunities. A large portion of companies are now hiring for remote work.
