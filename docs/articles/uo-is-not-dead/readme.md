UO Is Not Dead was a global listing of Ultima Online Freeshards, expecting to prove that there was yet a lot of shards out there.

It was not based on voting system, it was like a wiki.

Anyone could edit any shard at any time, and a revision history was kept to help people to undo eventual mistakes.

Anyone could add a shard on the list without the need of an account.

When clicking on a shard name, user could see a lot of details about the shard and also add/edit information and screenshots.

The website was totally programmed using Yii Framework (PHP). MySQL was used to hold the data. And the layout was based on Twitter Bootstrap.
