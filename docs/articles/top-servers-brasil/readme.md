- Generation of a simple banner for registered servers without a banner;
- Generation of thumbnails via JavaScript, using the [recrop](https://github.com/felladrin/recrop) library;
- Visits count for each server;
- Users can add servers without the need for registration.
- Categorization of servers by the name of the game they belong to, and count of servers in each game (games without registered servers are not listed).

- Administration panel for managing registered servers.
