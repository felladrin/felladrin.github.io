After droping UO Is Not Dead, I've joined JoinUO team to make a new portal, today available at http://uoportal.com/

For this I've used the php Yii Framework. The site template was not designed by me, it was available for free on the Internet.

The source code is available at [https://github.com/felladrin/joinuo](https://github.com/felladrin/joinuo)
